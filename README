To compile, you can use the makefile. To use it, place yourself inside the folder and use:

    make action ARG=CHARLOT_Rodolphe
    or make action ARG=CHAR*
   
You can see what the program returns, and it compiles and gives the res of glpsol inside the foler "./glpsol".
The result is inside the file "Res.dat", it uses "Data.dat"

To see what is used, see inside the makefile.

To see the code, you can see inside the .c files, called "qsort.c" and "solveRelaxation.c"
